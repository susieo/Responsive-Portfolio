                The barn owl (Tyto alba) is the most widely distributed species of owl and one of the most widespread of all birds. It is also 
                referred to as the common barn owl, to distinguish it from other species in its family, Tytonidae, which forms one of the two main lineages 
                of living owls, the other being the typical owls (Strigidae). The barn owl is found almost 
                everywhere in the world except polar and desert regions, Asia north of the Himalayas, most of Indonesia, and some Pacific islands.</p>    

            <p id="pa">
                    The barn owl is a medium-sized, pale-coloured owl with long wings and a short, squarish tail. There is considerable 
                    size variation across the subspecies with a typical specimen measuring about 33 to 39 cm (13 to 15 in) in overall length, 
                    with a full range of 29 to 44 cm (11 to 17 in) across the species. Barn owls have a typical wingspan of some 80 to 95 cm (31 to 37 in), 
                    with a full range of 68 to 105 cm (27 to 41 in). Adult body mass is also variable with male owls from the Galapagos (T. a. punctatissima) 
                    weighing approximately 260 g (9.2 oz) on average while male eastern barn owls (T. javanica) average 555 g (19.6 oz). The full known weight range 
                    for the barn owl species can range from 224 to 710 g (7.9 to 25.0 oz).[17] In general, owls 
                    living on small islands are smaller and lighter, perhaps because they have a higher dependence on insect prey and need to 
                    be more manoeuvrable.
